Defend (WIP)
==============

2D Game made with Unity 5 using C#, done in my spare time after work.

- Use the mouse to aim and fire to defend your base
- Don't forget to watch your ammo
- Your shield is good for 1 meteor
- Don't get hit by the meteors or it's game over

Video link: After I get some more features done

Progress
------------
All the core features are complete so far except for music.  
Done:
- Spawning meteors, size and spawn positions are random.
- Meteor waves. The chance of larger waves increases as the game progresses.
- UI - Menu buttons, in-game UI, custom mouse cursor.
- Player turret with a working animated shield and limited fire-able ammo. Camera shakes when hit.
- Game states: Can start, end with score and restart the game.
- Options and pause menu
- AI friendly turrets (still needs a way to spawn them, like via power ups)
- Sound effects (button select still needs work)

Potential future updates:
- Power ups
- Mobile port. Already supported in the code though I haven't been directly testing it.
- Different meteor types. The code has already been structured with this feature in mind.
- Environmental changes

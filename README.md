Defend (WIP)
==============

2D Game made with Unity 5.0 in C#, done in my spare time after work.

- Use the mouse to aim and fire to defend your base
- Don't forget to watch your ammo
- Your shield is good for 1 meteor
- Don't get hit by the meteors or it's game over

Video link: Coming soon

Progress
------------
All the core features are complete so far except for sound/music.  
Done:
- Spawning meteors, size and spawn positions are random.
- Meteor waves. The chance of a large wave increases as the game progresses.
- UI - Menu buttons, in-game UI, custom mouse cursor.
- Player turret with a working animated shield and limited fire-able ammo. Camera shakes when hit.
- Game states: Can start, end with scoring and restart the game.

Potential future updates:
- Different meteor types. The code has already been structured with this feature in mind.
- Power ups
- AI friendly turrets (As seen in the screenshot)
- Environmental changes
- Options menu
- Mobile port. This is already supported in the code though I haven't been testing it.
